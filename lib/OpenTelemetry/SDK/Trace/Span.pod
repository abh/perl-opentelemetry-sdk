=head1 NAME

OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Span - A single operation within a trace

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An instance of this class represents a single operation within a trace.

The API for this class is the same as L<OpenTelemetry::Trace::Span>, so please
refer to that module's documentation for details. While that module provides a
no-op implementation of the span interface, this one implements the behaviours
defined by the API.

As with the API module, the only supported way to create a span is through an
L<OpenTelemetry::Trace::Tracer>. Refer to the
L<create_span|OpenTelemetry::Trace::Tracer/create_span> method in that class
for details.
